# Connect Four

I wrote this basic C# connect four application in my first year at Plymouth University (2012), compared to current projects, this code is not of the highest quality, but I wanted to upload it to increase the breadth of my portfolio, as well as show clear progression of how I have advanced over the past 2 years.

The application allows for horizontal and vertical win checking, but I never got round to checking for diagonal wins (maybe I shall add that in a future release if I have time).

The code for this project can be found in Form1.cs (not the best naming convention, like I said above I hope I can get round to rewriting this!)
